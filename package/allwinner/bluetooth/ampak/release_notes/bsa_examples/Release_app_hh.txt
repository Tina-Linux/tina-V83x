This package contains the Bluetooth Application HID host (app_hh) on Linux.

To compile the Bluetooth application HID host have to type:
> cd 3rdparty/embedded/bsa_examples/linux/app_hh/build
> make			<= For PC/Linux target (default)
> make CPU=mips		<= For MIPS/Linux target

For PC/Linux target, the application executable is located in build/x86 folder.
To execute it, you have to go in the folder used to start the server application:
> cd  ../../server/build/
> ../../app_hh/build/x86/app_hh

In fact both server and applications need to access the named socket file (bt-daemon-socket),
which is created when the server is started.

For MIPS target, the application executable is located in build/mips folder.
To execute it, you have to copy and to execute it on the MIPS platform (from the same location used to execute the bt_server).

To use Mouse/Keyboard Linux Virtual driver (i.e cursor moves on screen when BT mouse moved) this application must be compiled with BTHID support.

In the HH makefile, the bthid variable must be set to TRUE (default is FALSE).
