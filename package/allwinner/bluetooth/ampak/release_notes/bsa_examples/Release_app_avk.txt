This package contains the Bluetooth av streaming example (app_av) on Linux.
The BTE version is BTE3.15.0.

To compile the Bluetooth application Manager have to type:
> cd 3rdparty/embedded/bsa_examples/linux/app_avk/build
> make			<= For PC/Linux target (default)
> make CPU=mips		<= For STB/Linux target

For PC/Linux target, the application executable is located in build/x86 folder.
To execute it, you have to go in the folder used to start the server application:
> cd  ../../server/build/
> ../../app_avk/build/x86/app_avk

Note that to play the received stream on Computer's speakers, the AVK application
support ALSA/asound driver. The Makefile must be modified to use this feature:
Add -lasound to LINK_LIB
Add 'GLOBAL_DEFINE += -DPCM_ALSA' to compile the ALSA code.


In fact both server and applications need to access the named socket file (bt-daemon-socket),
which is created when the server is started.

For MIPS target, the application executable is located in build/mips folder.
To execute it, you have to copy and to execute it on the MIPS platform (from the
same location used to execute the bt_server).
